          <p>You’ve probably heard it a thousand times before, “Studying abroad changes your life! You should definitely do it!” Think about it; why wouldn’t you take the opportunity to travel to a new country for a few months and experience a new way of life and gain a new perspective of the world as well as yourself?! Sure it’s a scary thought: going by yourself to a new place, not knowing anyone, and so unfamiliar with your surroundings. But even though that may be true, your experiences seeing the world, taking in a new culture, making lifelong friends, and gaining valuable life experience, are things that no one will ever be able to take away from you. </p>

          <p>For me, I chose to study abroad on the Gold Coast of Australia at Bond University. I chose it mainly because their school calendar aligns with the US, unlike other Australian universities who begin a month later in February and end in June. The campus has beautiful water fountains, clock towers, modern buildings, and a lake right in the center of campus. You’re put in small class sizes of 30 or fewer students, most of them Australians, as well as students from countries all across the globe. You have the option of living on campus in dorms or off campus in studio apartments. </p>
          <p>To get started, contact your study abroad office and tell them where you are interested in going. TELL THEM AUSTRALIA BECAUSE IT’S AMAZING! Contrary to what a lot of college students think, a semester abroad is actually around the same cost as a semester at your home university. If your school doesn’t offer a program through your college in particular, ask about programs such as The Education Abroad Network (TEAN), or International Studies Abroad (ISA), who offer opportunities to go virtually anywhere in the world. These programs offer scholarships before and after your trip as well so make sure you keep an eye out for those.  </p>

        <p>Living and studying abroad on the Gold Coast was easily the best four months of my entire life. The combination of the unparalleled nightlife, the natural beauty of the local beaches, mountains, and rainforest, learning at Bond University, and the diverse group of friends that I made, made the experience something that I will never forget. While the Gold Coast was definitely home for me in Australia, I had the opportunity to travel throughout the massive country to some popular tourist destinations. Flying within the country was relatively inexpensive so it was easy to capitalize on great deals and get away for the weekend. This website is dedicated to some of the top tourist cities and spots in Australia. </p>
          <p>In an attempt to make things easier for planning your holidays around Australia, I’ve put together a recommended itinerary for three or four days in various places. My aim with this website and these recommendations is to provide the first-time visitor with a combination of seeing and experiencing the most essential things to do in Australia. Happy travels!</p>
